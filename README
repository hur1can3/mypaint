mypaint:
  I have made a simple drawing program that has the following features:
      Draw points
      Draw lines
      Draw Circles (wireframe only)
      Draw Rectangles (wireframe only)
      FloodFill shapes
      8 different colors to choose from
      keyboard character input for selections
      right-click mouse menu system
      switch between two pixel sizes
      clear / reset drawing


keyboard mappings;

	keys:	function:
	0-9	change color (WHITE,BLACK,RED,GREEN,BLUE,CYAN,YELLOW,MAGENTA,ORANGE,PURPLE)
	p	point mode
	l	line mode
	c	circle mode
	r	rectangle mode
	f	floodfill mode
	b	pixel size
	x	clear screen
	q	quit / exit program   

*menu selections same except for color selection.

To draw a line:
  left click on starting point, move cursor and click again a line is drawn between points

to draw a circle:
  left click on starting point, move cursor and circle is drawn with radius size calculated from point distance

to floodfill:
  You first must have a closed shape like a circle or rectangle, or even make your own by connecting  lines.  Click inside the shape and it will be filled with the currently selected color.

** WARNING: do not attempt to fill an object that is not closed, or has multiple points / weird shapes inside of it as the floodfill algorithm may get stuck in infinite loop or have memory overflow.
